    Get task details input
        Options:
        1. Get the inputs for a target.
            The problem wil be that if a task isn't submitted it won't be stored.
        2. Store all the task inputs everytime anyone of them is changed.
            addEventListener for each of the inputs but call a unique function for storage
            Check all the tasks starting from the botton using the taskCount variable
