    Return button improved functionality:
        The return button must be smarter, it should remember what was the last
            page to return into it when clicked.
        For the memory of the last page we need a f() very similar to projectStorage.js
        But instead of using a object we can use a simple variable.
        Can we integrate the storage into this f() in the appendDOM.js?
        How many dashboards are there?
            Project edit: '.edit-project-dash'
            Projects: '.projects-dashboard'
            Upcoming tasks: '.upcoming-dash'
    

    Make the search bar work.
    Implement "date-fns"
    Implement "local-storage"
