    Make personal project work:
        Store created projects in an array
        The first item in this array will be the "Personal Project"
        The first step is making this functionality work, edit the "Personal Project"
            and after returning it must appear in the "Projects Dashboard".

    Projects button not working from task dashboard


    Make the search bar work.
    Make task projects work:
        Get the personal project to work.
            One can create tasks inside of it, exit the project and reopen it
                an the created tasks remain there.
    Add footer

Bugs:

            it produces a invalidad date format.
    
    projectDOM
        Won't add personal project the 2nd time because the DOMContentLoaded listener
            doesn't activate
