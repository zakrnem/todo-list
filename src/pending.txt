Pending:
    Make the search bar work.
        The search button will automatically open the 'upcomig tasks dashboard'.
        The search result dashboard will be very similar to that one but with element filtering.
        But fist we need to export to the console this filtered array.
        We will add an event listener for the search bar input field, with every input the array
            will be filtered more.

    Implement "date-fns"
    Implement "local-storage"
