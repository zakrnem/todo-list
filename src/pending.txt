Basic Functionality:
    User inputs task
    The task needs a constructor
    The task object has the following parameters:
        Title
        Description
        Due-date
        Priority
        Checklist
    We need to group tasks in different projects

Pseudocode:
    A function returns an object with the parameters that we need.
    The user inputs the task parameter in the argument of this function.
    This task can have no project.
    So we would have to display all task with no project in the first.
    If the user decides to specify a new project it'll create a "folder".
    The task should be editable.    


Modules:
    Task constructor: newTask.js
    Project constructor: newProject.js
