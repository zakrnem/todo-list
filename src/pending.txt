Pending:
    Remove button bug:
        When entering into the 'project edit dashboard' and using the 'projects'
            or 'upcoming tasks' button the return button isn't removed.
        So when ones enters the 'pj-edit-dash' again a new return button is added,
            creating multiple return buttons.
    Solution:
        Every time the 'projects' buttons is pressed the 'return' button must be
            removed, the 'projects dashboard' won't have a return button because
            is the main page.
    

    Make the search bar work.
    Implement "date-fns"
    Implement "local-storage"
