Bugs:
    When editing a project name that has content it creates a new project.
        When double clicking on it, it enters on the project with the unmodified title.
        We're currently identifying existing projects by their title.
        If we could identify them by an id this wouldn't happen.
        We need to store the project ID in the storedProject[]
        But this could affect our current logic for the projectCount variable that assigns
            the IDs in the DOM.
        Because it's adding ID's according to the number of projects on the dashboard,
            and they can change depending on which was the last project edited.
        So this part of the logic must change now the ID's on the DOM must assigned according
            to the properties stored in the object.

Considering this object:
[
    {
        "title": "Personal",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "index": 1,
                "title": "Candy",
                "description": "",
                "date": {
                    "month": null,
                    "date": null,
                    "year": null
                },
                "completed": false
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "title": "New project #2",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "index": 1,
                "title": "tgjr",
                "description": "",
                "date": {
                    "month": null,
                    "date": null,
                    "year": null
                },
                "completed": false
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "title": "New project #3",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "index": 1,
                "title": "Candy",
                "description": "",
                "date": {
                    "month": null,
                    "date": null,
                    "year": null
                },
                "completed": false
            }
        ]
    }
]
We must add a ID propertie to each project.
